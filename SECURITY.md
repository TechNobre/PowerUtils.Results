# Security


## Reporting Vulnerabilities

We take the security of our repositories seriously, which includes all source code repositories managed through our [GitHub organizations TechNobre](https://github.com/TechNobre).

All of our projects use GitHub issues to track issues. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any of our repositories, please use the issues area of the respective project to report the problem to us.

Furthermore, if you believe you have a solution for a vulnerability in any of our repositories, feel free to open a Pull Request with your suggested improvement. We will carefully review your contribution, and if it is confirmed to address the issue, it will be implemented in a future version.

Thank you for collaborating with us to make our projects safer and more secure.

### Preferred Language

We prefer all communications to be in English.


## Support

The support for a specific version of .NET in our project follows the same lifecycle as the .NET framework itself. However, even after the official support for a version of .NET ends, we will continue to make efforts to support older versions as long as it is feasible and does not hinder the progress of our project.

We understand that some users may be using older versions of .NET due to specific restrictions or requirements. We will strive to minimize any security issues and ensure a reliable experience, as long as maintaining these versions does not pose a significant obstacle to the project's progress.

However, it is important to note that after the support for a specific version of .NET ends, we reserve the right to discontinue support for that version if it hinders the progress and continuous evolution of our project. In such cases, we strongly recommend users to update to the latest supported versions to ensure security and take advantage of the latest features and improvements.

We are committed to balancing support for older versions with the need to advance and innovate. We value the feedback and needs of our community and will do our best to ensure a smooth transition and provide clear guidance regarding the supported versions of .NET.

### Previous Versions

Earlier versions of this project may not receive regular security updates. We strongly recommend updating to the latest version to ensure security and benefit from the latest fixes and improvements.


## Feature Discontinuation

In our project, discontinuation of a specific feature will be notified with a 6-month advance notice. We will utilize techniques such as using the `[Obsolete]` attribute provided by .NET itself and other available resources to indicate the discontinuation of the feature. These notifications will be communicated clearly and documented.

During this 6-month period, we encourage users to migrate to available alternatives or adjust their implementations to accommodate the discontinuation of the feature. We will strive to provide clear guidance and support during this transition period.

After the 6-month notification period, the discontinued feature will be removed from the project. The removal will be planned and controlled to minimize any negative impact.

However, in cases where the continued presence of the discontinued feature may compromise the security of our project, we reserve the right to remove the feature immediately without prior notice. The security and integrity of our project are our primary concerns, and we will take necessary measures to ensure its protection and stability.

We appreciate your understanding and collaboration during the feature discontinuation process, and we are available to clarify any doubts or provide additional guidance.
